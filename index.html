        Voluntary versus governmental responses to COVID-19 and their effect on
        mobility trends

    <div class="body_text">
      The initial outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 up-ended the status quo and
      brought the world to a halt with far-reaching and long-lasting
      ramifications. Individuals and nations responded to the COVID-19 pandemic
      by limiting social contact through voluntary isolation and lockdown
      policies in an effort to reduce infections.

        <a target=”_blank” href=https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility>Google’s mobility trends</a> track how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline period (January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020). The data offers insight into some of the ways human behavior and travel patterns changed as a result of the pandemic.

    <div class="body_text">
        As the scale and geographic reach of the pandemic swelled in the early months of 2020, mobility and travel contracted in tandem. Mobility to workplaces, retail and recreational places, and transit all observed drastic reductions as businesses closed and people shifted to online school and work.

        In sharp contrast to many countries, the US did not impose a nation-wide lockdown. The imposition  of <a target="_blank" href=https://ballotpedia.org/Status_of_lockdown_and_stay-at-home_orders_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020> stay-at-home orders</a>  and other health measures were left to the discretion of state governors. This devolution of public health decisions engendered a partisan divide in the response to the pandemic with many Republican leaders resisting stringent policies and comprehensive lockdowns. Out of 50 states, 43 imposed some sort of stay-at-home order; all 24 states led by Democratic governors issued stay-at-home orders in their states, while only 19 of the 26 Republican governors issued stay-at-home orders. The result was a myriad of mobility restrictions and timelines in the US. However, communities and individuals across the states uniformly responded to the pandemic by voluntarily reducing their mobility—at a rate that <a target=”_blank” href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21000895>outpaced health guidelines or policy restrictions.</a>

        The chart below illustrates the time lag between voluntary mobility reductions—as measured by the week when mobility observed the greatest decrease from the baseline—and government action.
