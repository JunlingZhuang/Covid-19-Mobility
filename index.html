        Voluntary versus governmental responses to COVID-19 and their effect on

      The initial outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 up-ended the status quo and
      brought the world to a halt with far-reaching and long-lasting
      ramifications. Individuals and nations responded to the COVID-19 pandemic
      by limiting social contact through voluntary isolation and lockdown
      policies in an effort to reduce infections.

        <a target=”_blank” href=https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility>Google’s mobility trends</a> track how visits and length of stay at different places change compared to a baseline period (January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020). The data offers insight into some of the ways human behavior and travel patterns changed as a result of the pandemic.

Mobility to workplaces, retail and recreational places, and transit all observed drastic reductions as businesses closed and people shifted to online school and work.
